# The Seller Helper Web App
This project is a demo web application using Spring Boot for backend and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (buit on top of the React framework) for Frontend.

## Get Started
We'll use docker to run this project. The following instruction assumes you have docker installed. If you do not have docker setup, check out the [docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/).

1. **Pull the backend image from Docker Hub**
```
docker pull jingnu/seller-helper-api-server:latest
```

2. **Create and run a new container for the backend from the image we just pulled**
```
docker run -d -p8080:8080 jingnu/seller-helper-api-server:latest
```
This command returns an id. Please take a note of the returned id for later debug purpose.

3. **Check if the container is running**,
```
docker ps | grep seller-helper-api-server:latest
```
you should see an output like:
```
4442d95d8fb8   seller-helper-api-server:latest   "java -jar seller-heâ€¦"   3 hours ago      Up 3 hours      0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp   naughty_chatterjee
```
In case you do not see the above output, use `docker logs <id-returned-from-step-2>` to debug.

4. **Pull the frontend image from Docker Hub**
```
docker pull jingnu/seller-helper-frontend
```

5. **Create and run a new container for the frontend from the image we just pulled**
```
docker run -p 3000:3000 seller-helper-frontend
```
You should see the above command returned: `ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000`. Now if you go to the localhost, you should see the app.

6. **All set! You should be able to interacting with the app on [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)!**
